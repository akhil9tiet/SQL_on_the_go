##1. We'll start by looking at SpeedySpoon's data. The orders table has a row for each order of a SpeedySpoon delivery. It says when the order took place, and who ordered it.##

select *
from orders
order by id
limit 100;
_______________________________________________________
##2. The order_items table lists the individual foods and their prices in each order##
select * 
from order_items
order by id
limit 100;
___________________________________________________________
##3. We'll begin with the Daily Count of orders placed. To make our Daily Count metric, we'll focus on the date function and the ordered_at field.##

##To get the Daily Metrics we need the date. Most dates in databases are timestamps, which have hours and minutes, as well as the year, month, and day. Timestamps look like 2015-01-05 14:43:31, while dates are the first part: 2015-01-05.

We can easily select the date an item was ordered at with the date function and the ordered_at field:

select date(ordered_at)
from orders;

Let's get a Daily Count of orders from the orders table. Complete the query using the date function to cast the timestamps in ordered_at to dates.##

select date(ordered_at)
from orders
order by 1
limit 100;

##The order by 1 statement is a shortcut for order by date(ordered_at). The 1 refers to the first column.##
__________________________________________________________
##4. Generally, when we count all records in a table we run a query with the count function, as follows:

select count(1)
from users;

This will treat all rows as a single group, and return one row in the result set - the total count.

To count orders by their dates, we'll use the date and count functions and pair them with the group by clause. Together this will count the records in the table, grouped by date.

For example, to see the user records counted by the date created, we use the date and count functions and group by clause as follows:

select date(created_at), count(1)
from users
group by date(created_at)##

Use the date and count functions and group by clause to count and group the orders by the dates they were ordered_at.

select date(ordered_at), count(1)
from orders
group by date(ordered_at)
order by date(ordered_at);

____________________________________________________________
5.We have the Daily Count of orders, but what we really want to know is revenue. How much money has SpeedySpoon made from orders each day?

We can make a few changes to our Daily Count query to get the revenue.

First, instead of using count(1) to count the rows per date, we'll use round(sum(amount_paid), 2) to add up the revenue per date. Complete the query by adding revenue per date.

Second, we need to join in the order_items table because that table has an amount_paid column representing revenue. Complete the query by adding a join clause where orders.id = order_items.order_id

select date(orders.ordered_at) AS 'Ordere Date', round(sum(order_items.amount_paid), 2) AS 'Total Revenue'
from orders join order_items on
orders.id = order_items.order_id
group by 1
order by 1;
___________________________

Nice. Now with a small change, we can find out how much we're making per day for any single dish. What's the daily revenue from customers ordering kale smoothies?

Complete the query by using a where clause to filter the daily sums down to orders where the name = 'kale-smoothie'.


select date(ordered_at), round(sum(amount_paid), 2)
from orders
    join order_items on 
      orders.id = order_items.order_id
where name = 'kale-smoothie'
group by 1
order by 1;

________________________________________________________________________

6. It looks like the smoothies might not be performing well, but to be sure we need to see how they're doing in the context of the other order items.

We'll look at the data several different ways, the first of which is determining what percent of revenue these smoothies represent.

To get the percent of revenue that each item represents, we need to know the total revenue of each item. We will later divide the per-item total with the overall total revenue.

The following query groups and sum the products by price to get the total revenue for each item. Complete the query by passing in sum(amount_paid) into the round function and rounding to two decimal places.

select name, round(sum(amount_paid), 2)
from order_items
group by name
order by 2 desc;

_____________________________________________________________________________
7. Great! We have the sum of the the products by revenue, but we still need the percent. For that, we'll need to get the total using a subquery. A subquery can perform complicated calculations and create filtered or aggregate tables on the fly.

Subqueries are useful when you want to perform an aggregation outside the context of the current query. This will let us calculate the overall total and per-item total at the same time.

Complete the denominator in the subquery, which is the total revenue from order_items. Use the sum function to query the amount_paid from the order_items table.

select name, round(sum(amount_paid) /
  (select sum(amount_paid) from order_items) * 100.0, 2) as pct
from order_items
group by 1
order by 2 desc;

We now have the percent or revenue each product represents!

Here order by 2 desc sorts by the second column (the percent) to show the products in order of their contribution to revenue.

8.As we suspected, kale smoothies are not bringing in the money. And thanks to this analysis, we found what might be a trend - several of the other low performing products are also smoothies.

Let's keep digging to find out what's going on with these smoothies.
_________________________________________________________________________________
9. To see if our smoothie suspicion has merit, let's look at purchases by category. We can group the order items by what type of food they are, and go from there. Since our order_items table does not include categories already, we'll need to make some!

Previously we've been using group by with a column (like order_items.name) or a function (like date(orders.ordered_at)).

We can also use group by with expressions. In this case a case statement is just what we need to build our own categories. case statements are similar to if/else in other languages. 
Here's the basic structure of a case statement:

case {condition}
  when {value1} then {result1}
  when {value2} then {result2}
  else {result3}
end

 We will build our own categories using a case statement. Complete the query below with a case condition of name that lists out each product, and decides its group.
 
 select *,
  case name
    when 'kale-smoothie'    then 'smoothie'
    when 'banana-smoothie'  then 'smoothie'
    when 'orange-juice'     then 'drink'
    when 'soda'             then 'drink'
    when 'blt'              then 'sandwich'
    when 'grilled-cheese'   then 'sandwich'
    when 'tikka-masala'     then 'dinner'
    when 'chicken-parm'     then 'dinner'
     else 'other'
  end as category
from order_items
order by id
limit 100;
____________________________

Complete the query by using the category column created by the case statement in our previous revenue percent calculation. Add the denominator that will sum the amount_paid.

select
  case name
    when 'kale-smoothie'    then 'smoothie'
    when 'banana-smoothie'  then 'smoothie'
    when 'orange-juice'     then 'drink'
    when 'soda'             then 'drink'
    when 'blt'              then 'sandwich'
    when 'grilled-cheese'   then 'sandwich'
    when 'tikka-masala'     then 'dinner'
    when 'chicken-parm'     then 'dinner'
    else 'other'
  end as category, round(1.0 * sum(amount_paid) /
    (select sum(amount_paid) from order_items) * 100, 2) as pct
from order_items
group by 1
order by 2 desc;

Ah ha! It's true that the whole smoothie category is performing poorly compared to the others.

We'll certainly take this discovery to SpeedySpoon. Before we do, let's go one level deeper and figure out why.

___________________________________________
11.While we do know that kale smoothies (and drinks overall) are not driving a lot of revenue, we don't know why. A big part of data analysis is implementing your own metrics to get information out of the piles of data in your database.

In our case, the reason could be that no one likes kale, but it could be something else entirely. To find out, we'll create a metric called reorder rate and see how that compares to the other products at SpeedySpoon.

We'll define reorder rate as the ratio of the total number of orders to the number of people making those orders. A lower ratio means most of the orders are reorders. A higher ratio means more of the orders are first purchases.

Let's calculate the reorder ratio for all of SpeedySpoon's products and take a look at the results. Counting the total orders per product is straightforward. We count the distinct order_ids in the order_items table.

Complete the query by passing in the distinct keyword and the order_id column name into the count function

select name, count(distinct order_id)
from order_items
group by 1
order by 1;

________________________________________________
Now we need the number of people making these orders.

To get that information, we need to join in the orders table and count unique values in the delivered_to field, and sort by the reorder_rate.

Complete the query below. The numerator should count the distinct order_ids. The denominator should count the distinct values of the orders table's delivered_to field (orders.delivered_to).

select name, round(1.0 * count(distinct order_id) /
count(distinct orders.delivered_to), 2) as reorder_rate
from order_items
join orders on
orders.id = order_items.order_id
group by 1
order by 2 desc;
___________________________________________________

Wow! That's unexpected. While smoothies aren't making a lot of money for SpeedySpoon, they have a very high reorder rate. That means these smoothie customers are strong repeat customers.

Instead of recommending smoothies be taken off the menu, we should talk to the smoothie customers and see what they like so much about these smoothies. There could be an opportunity here to expand the product line, or get other customers as excited as these kale fanatics. Nice work! 

Let's generalize what we've learned so far:

    Data aggregation is the grouping of data in summary form.
    Daily Count is the count of orders in a day.
    Daily Revenue Count is the revenue on orders per day.
    Product Sum is the total revenue of a product.
    Subqueries can be used to perform complicated calculations and create filtered or aggregate tables on the fly.
    Reorder Rate is the ratio of the total number of orders to the number of people making orders.
