1. Introduction
As a data scientist, when you're not investigating spikes or dips in your data, you might be building dashboards of KPIs, or key performance indicators for a company.

KPIs are often displayed on TVs on the walls of the office, and serve as high level health metrics for the business. While every company's metrics are defined slightly differently, the basics are usually very similar.

In this lesson we'll take a look at basic KPIs like Daily Revenue, Daily Active Users, ARPU, and Retention for a video game, Mineblocks.
________________________________________________________________

This company has two tables, gameplays and purchases. The purchases table lists all purchases made by players while they're playing Mineblocks.

Complete the query to select from purchases.

select *
from purchases
order by id
limit 10;
____________________________________________________________________

The gameplays table lists the date and platform for each session a user plays.

Select from gameplays.
select *
from gameplays
order by id
limit 10;
___________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________
2.At the heart of every company is revenue, and Mineblocks is no exception. For our first KPI we'll calculate daily revenue.
_____________________________________________________________________
Daily Revenue is simply the sum of money made per day.

To get close to Daily Revenue, we calculate the daily sum of the prices in the purchases table. Complete the query by using the sum function and passing the price column from the purchases table.

select date(created_at), round(sum(price),2)
from ourchases
group by 1
order by 1;
_________________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________________
3. Great! That query doesn't take refunds into account. We'll update the query to exclude refunds.

Fields like refunded_at will only have data if the transaction was refunded, and otherwise left null.
_________________________________________________________________________
Update our daily revenue query to exclude refunds. Complete the query by filtering for refunded_at is not null

select date(created_at), round(sum(price),2) as daily_rev
from purchases
where refunded_at is not NULL
group by 1
order by 1;

_________________________________________________________________________
__________________________________________________________________________
4. Daily Active Users

Mineblocks is a game, and one of the core metrics to any game is the number people who play each day. That KPI is called Daily Active Users, or DAU.

DAU is defined as the number of unique players seen in-game each day. It's important not to double count users who played multiple times, so we'll use distinct in our count function.
________________________________________________________________________________

Likewise, Weekly Active Users (WAU) and Monthly Active Users (MAU) are in the same family.
_________________________________________________________________________________
For Mineblocks, we'll use the gameplays table to calculate DAU. Each time a user plays the game, their session is recorded in gameplays. Thus, a distinct count of users per day from gameplays will give us DAU.

Calculate Daily Active Users for Mineblocks. Complete the query's count function by passing in the distinct keyword and the user_id column name.

select
  date(created_at), 
  count(distinct user_id) as dau
from gameplays
group by 1
order by 1;
____________________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________________
5. Daily Active Users 2

Great! Since Mineblocks is on multiple platforms, we can calculate DAU per-platform.
______________________________________________________________________________________

reviously we calculated DAU only per day, so the output we wanted was [date, dau_count]. Now we want DAU per platform, making the desired output [date, platform, dau_count].

Calculate DAU for Mineblocks per-platform. Complete the query below. You will need to select the platform column and add a count function by passing in the distinct keyword and the user_id column name.

select
  date(created_at), platform
  count(distinct user_id) as dau
from gameplays
group by 1,2
order by 1,2;

_______________________________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________________________________
6. Daily average per purchasing user

We've looked at DAU and Daily Revenue in Mineblocks. Now we must understand the purchasing habits of our users.

Mineblocks, like every freemium game, has two types of users:

purchasers: users who have bought things in the game
players: users who play the game but have not yet purchased

The next KPI we'll look at Daily ARPPU - Average Revenue Per Purchasing User. This metric shows if the average amount of money spent by purchasers is going up over time.

Daily ARPPU is defined as the sum of revenue divided by the number of purchasers per day.

__________________________________________________________________________________________
To get Daily ARPPU, modify the daily revenue query from earlier to divide by the number of purchasers.

Complete the query by adding a numerator and a denominator. The numerator will display daily revenue, or sum the price columns. The denominator will display the number of purchasers by passing the distinct keyword and the user_id column name into the count function.

select
  date(created_at),
  round(sum(price)/count(distinct user_id),2) as arppu  
from purchases
where refunded_at is null
group by 1
order by 1;
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
7. Daily average revenue per user
The more popular (and difficult) cousin to Daily ARPPU is Daily ARPU, Average Revenue Per User. ARPU measures the average amount of money we're getting across all players, whether or not they've purchased.

ARPPU increases if purchasers are spending more money. ARPU increases if more players are choosing to purchase, even if the purchase size stays consistent.

No one metric can tell the whole story. That's why it's so helpful to have many KPIs on the same dashboard.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
______________________________________________________________________________________________
8.ARPU2

Daily ARPU is defined as revenue divided by the number of players, per-day. To get that, we'll need to calculate the daily revenue and daily active users separately, and then join them on their dates.

One way to easily create and organize temporary results in a query is with CTEs, Common Table Expressions, also known as with clauses. The with clauses make it easy to define and use results in a more organized way than subqueries.

These clauses usually look like this:
 with {subquery_name} as (
    {subquery_body}
  )
  select ...
  from {subquery_name}
  where ...
  ____________________________________________________________________________________________
  Use a with clause to define daily_revenue and then select from it.
  
  with daily_revenue as (
select
date(created_at) as dt,
round(sum(price), 2) as rev
from purchases
where refunded_at is null
group by 1
)
select * from daily_revenue order by dt;
______________________________________________________________________________________________
______________________________________________________________________________________________
9. APPRU2
Great! Now you're familiar with using the with clause to create temporary result sets.

You just built the first part of ARPU, daily_revenue. From here we can build the second half of ARPU in our with clause, daily_players, and use both together to create ARPU.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
Building on this CTE, we can add in DAU from earlier. Complete the query by calling the DAU query we created earlier, now aliased as daily_players:

with daily_revenue as (
select
date(created_at) as dt,
round(sum(price), 2) as rev
from purchases
where refunded_at is null
group by 1
),
daily_players as(
select date(created_at) as dt,
count(distinct user_id) as players
  from gameplays
  group by 1)
select * from daily_players order by dt;
_________________________________________________________________________________________________
Now that we have the revenue and DAU, join them on their dates and calculate daily ARPU. Complete the query by adding the keyword using in the join clause.

with daily_revenue as (
select
date(created_at) as dt,
round(sum(price), 2) as rev
from purchases
where refunded_at is null
group by 1
),
daily_players as (
select date(created_at) as dt,
count(distinct user_id) as players
from gameplays
group by 1
)
select 
daily_revenue.dt,
daily_revenue.rev / daily_players.players 
from daily_revenue
join daily_players using (dt);
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
10. ARPU3
Nice work, you just defined ARPU for Mineblocks!

In our ARPU query, we used 'using' instead of on in the 'join' clause. This is a special case join.

from daily_revenue
  join daily_players using (dt);
  
When the columns to join have the same name in both tables you can use using instead of on. Our use of the using keyword is in this case equivalent to this clause:

from daily_revenue
  join daily_players on
    daily_revenue.dt = daily_players.dt;

______________________________________________________________________________________________________
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
11. Daily retention
Now let's find out what percent of Mineblock players are returning to play the next day. This KPI is called 1 Day Retention.

Retention can be defined many different ways, but we'll stick to the most basic definition. For all players on Day N, we'll consider them retained if they came back to play again on Day N+1.

This will let us track whether or not Mineblocks is getting "stickier" over time. The stickier our game, the more days players will spend in-game.

And more time in-game means more opportunities to monetize and grow our business.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
12. 1 day retention 2
Before we can calculate retention we need to get our data formatted in a way where we can determine if a user returned.

Currently the gameplays table is a list of when the user played, and it's not easy to see if any user came back.

By using a self-join, we can make multiple gameplays available on the same row of results. This will enable us to calculate retention.

The power of self-join comes from joining every row to every other row. This makes it possible to compare values from two different rows in the new result set. In our case, we'll compare rows that are one date apart from each user.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
To calculate retention, start from a query that selects the date(created_at) as dt and user_id columns from the gameplays table.
select
  date(created_at) as dt,
  user_id
from gameplays as g1
order by dt
limit 100;
_____________________________________________________________________
Now we'll join gameplays on itself so that we can have access to all gameplays for each player, for each of their gameplays.

This is known as a self-join and will let us connect the players on Day N to the players on Day N+1. In order to join a table to itself, it must be aliased so we can access each copy separately.

We aliased gameplays in the query above because in the next step, we need to join gameplays to itself so we can get a result selecting [date, user_id, user_id_if_retained].

Complete the query by using a join statement to join gameplays to itself on user_id using the aliases g1 and g2.

select
    date(g1.created_at) as dt,
    g1.user_id
  from gameplays as g1
     join gameplays as g2 on 
     g1.user_id = g2.user_id
  order by 1
  limit 100;

We don't use the using clause here because the join is about to get more complicated.
_____________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________

13. 1 Day retention 3

Now that we have our gameplays table joined to itself, we can start to calculate retention.

1 Day Retention is defined as the number of players who returned the next day divided by the number of original players, per day. Suppose 10 players played Mineblocks on Dec 10th. If 4 of them play on Dec 11th, the 1 day retention for Dec 10th is 40%.
______________________________________________________________________________________
The previous query joined all rows in gameplays against all other rows for each user, making a massive result set that we don't need.

We'll need to modify this query.

select
  date(g1.created_at) as dt,
  g1.user_id,
  g2.user_id
from gameplays as g1
   join gameplays as g2 on 
   g1.user_id = g2.user_id
   and date(g1.created_at) =  date(datetime(g2.created_at, '-1 day'))
order by 1
limit 100;

This means "only join rows where the date in g1 is one less than the date in g2", which makes it possible to see if users have returned!
___________________________________________________________________________________________________
The query above won't return meaningful results because we're using an inner join. This type of join requires that the condition be met for all rows, effectively limiting our selection to only the users that have returned.

Instead, we want to use a left join, this way all rows in g1 are preserved, leaving nulls in the rows from g2 where users did not return to play the next day.

Change the join clause to use left join and count the distinct number of users from g1 and g2 per date.

select
  date(g1.created_at) as dt,
  count(distinct g1.user_id) as total_users,
  count(distinct g2.user_id) as retained_users
from gameplays as g1
  left join gameplays as g2 on
    g1.user_id = g2.user_id
    and date(g1.created_at) = date(datetime(g2.created_at, '-1 day'))
group by 1
order by 1
limit 100;
___________________________________________________________________________________________________
Now that we have retained users as count(distinct g2.user_id) and total users as count(distinct g1.user_id), divide retained users by total users to calculate 1 day retention!

select
  date(g1.created_at) as dt,
  round(100 * count(distinct g2.user_id) / count(distinct g1.user_id)) as retention
from gameplays as g1
  left join gameplays as g2 on
    g1.user_id = g2.user_id
    and date(g1.created_at) = date(datetime(g2.created_at, '-1 day'))
group by 1
order by 1
limit 100;
