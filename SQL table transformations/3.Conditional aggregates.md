1. Aggregate functions revisited

Aggregate functions compute a single result from a set of multiple input values. You can think of aggregate data as data collected from multiple rows at a time. In this lesson, we'll continue learning about aggregate functions by focusing on conditionals, sums, and combining aggregate functions.

Conditional Aggregates are aggregate functions that compute a result set based on a given set of conditions.
___________________________
The count function is an aggregate function, since it aggregates data from multiple rows.

Count the number of rows in the flights table, representing the total number of flights contained in the table.

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM flights;

2. NULL

While working with databases, it's common to have empty or unknown "cells" in data tables. For example, in our first flights table, we keep track of when flights arrive in a column called arr_time:

id  origin  Destination dep_time            arr_time
1   DTW     BNA         2003-11-30          2003-11-30
                        11:10:0.0000000     11:33:0.00000

3 OAk       SNA         2005-05-11          NULL
                        06:45:00.0000000
In this table, the third flight was canceled and therefore did not have an arrive time. We'll leave this cell empty, which is denoted as NULL.   
What do we do when we need to test whether a value is or is not null? We use the special keywords IS NULL or IS NOT NULL in the WHERE clause (= NULL does not work).
_____________________________________

Count the number of rows from the flights table, where arr_time is not null and the destination is ATL.

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM flights
where arr_time is not NULL and
destination = 'ATL';

3. Case When

Almost every programming language has a way to represent "if, then, else", or conditional logic. In SQL, we represent this logic with the CASE statement, as follows:

SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN elevation < 500 THEN 'Low'
        WHEN elevation BETWEEN 500 AND 1999 THEN 'Medium'
        WHEN elevation >= 2000 THEN 'High'
        ELSE 'Unknown'
    END AS elevation_tier
    , COUNT(*)
FROM airports
GROUP BY 1;

In the above statement, END is required to terminate the statement, but ELSE is optional. If ELSE is not included, the result will be NULL. Also notice the shorthand method of referencing columns to use in GROUP BY, so we don't have to rewrite the entire Case Statement.

________________________________
Modify the case statement's such that when the elevation is less than 250, the elevation_tier column returns 'Low', when between 250 and 1749 it returns 'Medium', and when greater than or equal to 1750 it returns 'High'.

Be sure to alias the conditional statement as elevation_tier, in your query.

SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN elevation < 250 THEN 'Low'
        WHEN elevation BETWEEN 250 AND 1750 THEN 'Medium'
        WHEN elevation >= 1750 THEN 'High'
        ELSE 'Unknown'
    END AS elevation_tier
    , COUNT(*)
FROM airports
GROUP BY 1;
_____________________________________

4. Count(Case when)

Sometimes you want to look at an entire result set, but want to implement conditions on certain aggregates.

For instance, maybe you want to identify the total amount of airports as well as the total amount of airports with high elevation in the same result set. We can accomplish this by putting a CASE WHEN statement in the aggregate.

SELECT    state, 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN elevation >= 2000 THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) as count_high_elevation_aiports 
FROM airports 
GROUP BY state;
__________________________________
Using the same pattern, write a query to count the number of low elevation airports by state where low elevation is defined as less than 1000 ft.

Be sure to alias the counted airports as count_low_elevation_airports.

SELECT    state, 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN elevation < 1000 THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) as count_low_elevation_aiports 
FROM airports 
GROUP BY state;
_______________________
____________________
5. Sum (Case when)

We can do that same thing for other aggregates like SUM(). For instance, if we wanted to sum the total flight distance and compare that to the sum of flight distance from a particular airline (in this case, United Airlines) by origin airport, we could run the following query:

SELECT origin, sum(distance) as total_flight_distance, sum(CASE WHEN carrier = 'UA' THEN distance ELSE 0 END) as total_united_flight_distance 
FROM flights 
GROUP BY origin;
_________________________________
Using the same pattern, find both the total flight distance as and flight distance by origin for Delta (carrier = 'DL').

Alias the flight distance as total_flight_distance and the and flight distance by origin as total_delta_flight_distance.

SELECT origin, sum(distance) as total_flight_distance, sum(CASE WHEN carrier = 'DL' THEN distance ELSE 0 END) as total_delta_flight_distance 
FROM flights 
GROUP BY origin;
______________________
____________________
6. Combining aggregates
Oftentimes we'd like to combine aggregates, to create percentages or ratios.

In the instance of the last query, we might want to find out the percent of flight distance that is from United by origin airport. We can do this simply by using the mathematical operators we need in SQL:

SELECT     origin, 
    100.0*(sum(CASE WHEN carrier = 'UN' THEN distance ELSE 0 END)/sum(distance)) as percentage_flight_distance_from_united FROM flights 
GROUP BY origin;

_____________________________
Using the same pattern, find the percentage of flights from Delta by origin (carrier = 'DL')

In the query, alias the column as percentage_flight_distance_from_delta

SELECT     origin, 
    100.0*(sum(CASE WHEN carrier = 'DL' THEN distance ELSE 0 END)/sum(distance)) as percentage_flight_distance_from_delta FROM flights 
GROUP BY origin;
________________________________________
_________________________________________
7. Combing aggregates 2
Modify the previous elevation example to find the percentage of high elevation airports (elevation >= 2000) by state.
__________________________
Find the percentage of high elevation airports (elevation >= 2000) by state from the airports table.

In the query, alias the percentage column as percentage_high_elevation_airports.

ELECT  
    100.0*(sum(CASE WHEN elevation >=2000 THEN elevation ELSE 0 END)/sum(elevation)) as percentage_high_elevation_airports FROM airports 
GROUP BY origin;

8.Generalizations
Congratulations! You just learned about Conditional Aggregates in SQL. What can we generalize so far?

Conditional Aggregates are aggregate functions the compute a result set based on a given set of conditions.
NULL can be used to denote an empty field value
CASE statements allow for custom classification of data
CASE statements can be used inside aggregates (like SUM() and COUNT()) to provide filtered measures
